Time and Space Complexity 
 Asymptotic analysis => analysing No of operation as a function of input is called aysmptotic analysis

======================== 
If A1  algo takes 10^8 operations and A2 algo takes 10 operation the based on the operation we can say A2 is better algo than A1.

if A1 algorithm takes 1 second time and A2 algo takes 2 second time to execute same program still we can not say which algorithm is better
because running time depends on below factors
1 = Logic of algorithm
2= language like scripting languages  javascriptand python takes more time in comarison to compiled languages like java to execute the instructions
3= Machine mack book pro always takes less time than windows i3 machine due to its processor.

Hence we decide the best algorithm on the basis of no operations it doing 
less no of operation is better than the algo takes more no of algorithm
== Analyze the algorithm based on running time is called experimental analysis.
